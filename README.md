# Rust-Dump

I am learning Rust in 2021, and this will take some time. The end goal is to be able to understand the codebase of PopOS and contribute. I'll be writing my own compiler using Rust once I feel more comfortable.

Please note that for now, this repo is just gonna be stacked with all the codes I'm writing while learning, and can be easily ignored. Very soon, I'll make it organized and share my notes.

Thanks!
