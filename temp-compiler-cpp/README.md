**Note:**

- I'm currently attempting to write a compiler (will add references soon) in C++ and while I'm learning Rust - I'll attempt to port this to Rust.
- This is in WIP stage.

**Why C++ and not Rust now?**

- I'm more comfortable with C++ right now.
- I'm still learning Rust, and it will take me some time to get comfortable.
- I don't want to delay learning compiler development.

This is highly inspired from these resources:
